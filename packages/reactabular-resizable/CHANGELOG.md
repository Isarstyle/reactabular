8.18.0 / 2020-01-27
==================

  * Fix - Allow nested columns to have a width. #375

8.12.0 / 2017-10-05
==================

  * Chore - Support React 16. #324

8.6.0 / 2017-01-16
==================

  * Bug fix - Bump lodash peer dependency to v4 minimum. This was expected already, but the version was wrong.

8.4.0 / 2016-12-01
==================

  * Feature - Expose `resizable.column` `onDragStart` and `onDragEnd`. These work the same way as `onDrag` except at the beginning and the end of the process.

8.3.1 / 2016-11-30
==================

  * Bug fix - Make sure `helper` doesn't crash if `props` are missing from a column.

8.3.0 / 2016-11-30
==================

  * Feature - Pass `index` to `helper` `getId`. The enhanced signature is `getId(column, index)`.
  * Bug fix - Make sure `helper` merges class names correctly if there are multiple.

8.0.0 / 2016-11-27
==================

  * Feature - Allow `minWidth` to be set per `column` explicitly.
  * Breaking - Push performance optimized resizing to a function. As a result `reactabular-resizable` exposes `column` and `helper` functions now. `column` is the same as before. `helper` implements optional performance optimizations. See the README for usage instructions.

6.0.0 / 2016-10-14
==================

  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.

5.3.0 / 2016-10-05
==================

  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.

3.0.0 / 2016-09-01
==================

  * Feature - Expose `parent` prop (defaults to `document`). This is handy if you use an iframe and need something more custom.

2.0.0 / 2016-08-16
==================

  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.
  * Feature - Document how to offset the widget. #179.

1.2.2 / 2016-08-07
==================

  * Bug fix - Fix README example as Sticky API has been simplified (no need for ReactDOM anymore).

0.1.0 / 2016-07-26
==================

  * Initial release.
